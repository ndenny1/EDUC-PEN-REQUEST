# EDUC-PEN-REQUEST
This project contains the frontend for PEN requests. 

# Ministry of Education PEN Request
The PEN request application consists of a Vue.js frontend (UI and UX) and a Node.js backend (auth and session management). Currently early in the development process, so the front and backend are currently quite thin (only a single UI page).
